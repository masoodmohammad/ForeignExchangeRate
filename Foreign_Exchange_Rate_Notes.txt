Below are the actions i have performed to the given Assignment:

> Based on the provided user story i have written 12 manual test cases which covers positive and negative scenarios
> I have developed the framework using Cucumber
> In this framework i have followed Behaviour Driven Development approach
> I am generating Extent reports as well
> Total i have developed 6 test scripts in which 3 belongs to 'Date specific Exchange rate APIs' and the remaining 3
  belongs to 'Latest Exchange rate APIs'
> Out of 6, 1 test case belongs to Sanity Testing and rest 5 belongs to Regression Testing
> In TestRunner i am executing only Regression suite by updating the tags field
> Due to the time constraint i did the response validation in normal approach, otherwise i can achieve the same using 
  Hamcrest/JsonPath/POJO Classes   
> For the future date API hit test case, i am verifying the resposne match with Current date (Since i am working in IST 
  time zone i am retrieving the previous date instead of current date)
